Hi Vishad,

Hope you are doing well.

Can you go through the below links and start working on contributing to your Github repos ASAP?

https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Once you are comfortable with github you can create your own project and commit your efforts to it.

Kindly do it on priority.

Let me know in case of any issues.


PS : The python course you are currently persuing can be used as a pilot proj for this.

Hi Vishad,

Hope you are doing well.

I was going through your Github a/c and could not find a repo for CS101 from Udacity.

In case you have not created it yet, can you create one now?

Use below link for creating a repo in github (use repo name as "CS101-udacity")

https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/

Once done we can start contributing to it collaboratively.
